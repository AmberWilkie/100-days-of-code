# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day -3: Friday, January 6, 2017
#### First day back at a computer, for real, after Morocco

**Today's Progress**: Finished the jQuery intro tutorial. Worked through the first #Javascript30 video.

**Thoughts:**
- There's so much shit I don't know about Javascript.

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day -2: Saturday, January 7, 2017
#### Did a lot of shopping today, but still managed to get my brain to do this

**Today's Progress**: More or less figured out Javascript Day 2 on my own, once I got the correct function calls and CSS properties from the dude. It was a pretty simple one, really.

**Thoughts:**
- There's so much shit I don't know about CSS.

**Fuck-ups:**
- No need to work out AM/PM on the clock. 361 degrees == 1 degrees. Dur.

**Link to work:** [CSS Clock](https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/02%20-%20JS%20%2B%20CSS%20Clock)

## Day -1: Sunday, January 8, 2017
#### Our very first real "coffee date".

**Today's Progress**: More or less figured out Javascript Day 2 on my own, once I got the correct function calls and CSS properties from the dude. It was a pretty simple one, really.

**Thoughts:**
- Holy crap, CSS variables are awesome.

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day 1: Monday, January 9, 2017
#### The official first day of #100DaysOfCode for #CodeNewbies

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 of #Javascript30 - all about arrays and array functions.

**Thoughts:**
- Tough stuff! Lots of technical talk and wrapping your head around iterations and such. I'm demonstrably better at Javascript already.
- I need to spend more time understanding `.reduce()`

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day 2: Tuesday, January 10, 2017
#### Mega CSS day: Flexbox

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of #Javascript30 - the CSS Flexbox (cool stuff)

**Thoughts:**
- Tons of things I don't know about CSS. Should bone up on that a bit so I can make things pretty.
- Flexbox is cool.

**Fuck-ups:**

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/05%20-%20Flex%20Panel%20Gallery

## Day 3: Wednesday, January 11, 2017
#### Working more with `.filter()` and Regex

**Today's Progress**: Day 6 of #Javascript30 - more basic stuff and also easy callbacks!

**Thoughts:**
- Need to find a time when I can do some more digging into these concepts I am just marking to figure out later.

**Fuck-ups:**
- You can't fuck up that much on tutorials, really.

**Link to work:**

## Day 4: Friday, January 13, 2017
#### The easiest #Javascript30 video yet.

**Today's Progress**: Day 7 of #Javascript30 - some more array methods.

**Thoughts:**
- This video was pretty easy, partially because I am starting to get more familiar with the JS syntax itself.
- I had to miss a day yesterday because we had company for dinner.

**Fuck-ups:**
- I really could have pushed and worked last night, but then I'd have had zero relaxation time and one needs relaxation time.

## Day 5: Sunday, January 15, 2017
#### I'm going to count two days today. Yesterday was ...yes.

**Today's Progress**: Day 8 of #Javascript30 - fun stuff with canvas and drawing.

**Thoughts:**
- HSL color picker is a handy guy that is more logical than hex codes.
- Need to keep `if(!var) return;` in mind for shutting down functions in the middle.

**Fuck-ups:**
- Yesterday was just fun, but I could have squeezed in work time in the morning. Thankfully I intend to make up for it today.

## Day 6: Sunday, January 15, 2017
#### I'm going to count two days today.

**Today's Progress**: Day 9 of #Javascript30 - fun stuff with canvas and drawing.

**Thoughts:**
- Today's video was just a bunch of `console.log` options. It works out ok because the canvas thing was colorful and fun.

## Day 7: Monday, January 16, 2017
#### I'm going to count two days today.

**Today's Progress**: Day 10 of #Javascript30 - shift and checkboxes.

**Thoughts:**
- I did it! I used a bunch of `if` statements and `while` loops and far too many `eventListener`s but no worries, it's done.
- Feels good to get a thing right, even if it needs significant refactoring.
- `e` has `.shiftKey` available. Probably all kinds of useful other stuff, too.

## Day 8: Tuesday, January 17, 2017
#### All about videos on #Javascript30

**Today's Progress**: Day 11 of #Javascript30 - styling the video player.

**Thoughts:**
- Did it again, mostly.
- `if` statements are way out of style.
- Need to remember `offsetWidth` for finding the width of elements, as they are (not as set in CSS).

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/11%20-%20Custom%20Video%20Player

## Day 9: Wednesday, January 18, 2017
#### Silly key sequence detection

**Today's Progress**: Day 12 of #Javascript30 - key seq detection.

**Thoughts:**
- I didn't expect to have time today, so that's a win.
- `.splice()` is a helpful little method

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/12%20-%20Key%20Sequence%20Detection

## Day 10: Thursday, January 19, 2017
#### Animating images in on scroll

**Today's Progress**: Day 13 of #Javascript30.

**Thoughts:**
- There are *so many* window events.
- I can't imagine ever using this particular animation, but knowing about `scroll` properties and other window events is really great.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/13%20-%20Slide%20in%20on%20Scroll

## Day 11: Friday, January 20, 2017
#### Copy vs. Reference

**Today's Progress**: Day 14 of #Javascript30.

**Thoughts:**
- This lesson was really boring but ok, probably important.
- Who knew you couldn't just copy arrays and expect them to carry on as though they were completely new objects!

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/14%20-%20JavaScript%20References%20VS%20Copying

## Day 12: Saturday, January 21, 2017
#### localStorage & event delegation

**Today's Progress**: Day 15 of #Javascript30.

**Thoughts:**
- Lots of good stuff today - good learning going on.
- Halfway through the Javascript30 challenge!
- Really happy about all the protesting today around the world. If only it can be momentum that *builds* and we can fight authoritarianism and hatred in all forms.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/15%20-%20LocalStorage

## Day 13: Sunday, January 22, 2017
#### Working on a personal project: "Gö-vents" (until I can think of a better name)

**Today's Progress**:
- Added a "today" button to search for things happening today.
- Removed the crazy-confusing web-scraping we put together during a hack-a-thon and used the API Gothenburg produces (whoops on not finding that before).

**Thoughts:**
- I thought I might get this guy in a position to put in my portfolio today but no such luck.
- I need to add a lot more styling to this guy - hopefully some cards for each event.
- I'd also like to pull in more places to search - things like the library, perhaps, which I think are actually not being added here, but also music venues, Chalmers, etc.
- I hate "Gö-vents" (the name) so much I might die.

## Day 14: Monday, January 24, 2017
#### Drop-shadow animation with Javascript

**Today's Progress**:
- #Javascript30 Day 16
- Liked it so much I threw the code into my portfolio. Made it subtle enough so folks who hate it can safely ignore it.

**Thoughts:**
- My portfolio is so childish... I need to figure out a nicer presentation.
- On the other hand, I need to build some stuff that didn't come directly from the camp.

## Day 15: Thurdsay, January 25, 2017
#### Fighting with APIs

**Today's Progress**:
- Added Facebook events to event aggregator. I have three APIs working on the damn app now.

**Thoughts:**
- Facebook API is really not documented as well as one might think.

**To do:**
- Prettify the damn thing up. I want to get cards working from foundation so this thing actually looks nice and I can add it to the portfolio.

## Day 16: Friday, January 26, 2017
#### Fighting with Foundation and Alignment

**Today's Progress**:
- Installed Foundation to "Gö-vents" (Jesus, that needs a new name)
- Wrapped responses in Foundation's accordion, and those in the grid.


**Thoughts:**
- Why is it always so damn hard to get things aligned?

**To do:**
- Work out some system to expand across the entire screen if the other guys aren't going to be around (of the three data types).

## Day 17: Saturday, January 27, 2017
#### Bubble Sort, Intro to Algorithms

**Today's Progress**:
- Day 17 (they finally sink up!) of #Javascript30 - bubble sort (again). I think I get it much better this time around.
- Also spent some time reading the start of the enormous damn textbook I got on algorithms.


**Thoughts:**
- That textbook is huge. And it's got a lot of math. I'm a little scared, but I'm plunging ahead.
- I'm so torn with all the things I want to learn, all the things I want to build.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/17%20-%20Sort%20Without%20Articles

## Day 18: Sunday, January 28, 2017
#### Merge Sort, Intro to Algorithms

**Today's Progress**:
- Not much, honestly. I spent a long time thinkig about Merge Sort but couldn't get any of my code to actually work. I think Ruby may be recursively calling the methods in a different way than the textbook would suggest.


**Thoughts:**
- Ok, algorithms are hard.


## Day 19: Tuesday, January 29, 2017
#### Merge Sort, Intro to Algorithms

**Today's Progress**:
- Ok I think I finally understand how this program is excecuting, but it took a long time.


**Thoughts:**
- I really still didn't understand this until I started writing it and wanted to illustrate with a dead-stupid example. Now it makes sense, though I'm not fully convinced I have it right.

## Day 20: Thursday, February 2, 2017
#### Long overdue changes to website

**Today's Progress**:
- I finally got the desert to show up on my website
- I reduced the photo galleries down to Travel & everything else
- I updated my About Me so people maybe stop thinking I'm available


**Thoughts:**
- I'll get back into it soon. Been coding a lot at work so I'm a little burnt out at night.

**Link to work:**

## Day 21: Saturday, February 4, 2017
#### Back to algorithms

**Today's Progress**:
- Read but mostly glossed over Chapter 3
- Worked through the first algorithm in Chapter 4

**Thoughts:**
- Much easier to work with recursive methods once you understand recursion. Also, I probably got lucky.
- Also also, I am not that good at refactoring shit.

## Day 22: Sunday, February 5, 2017
#### #Javascript30 and Twitter bots

**Today's Progress**:
- Mostly did #Javascript30 Day 18 on my own
- Worked with the Twitter API but eventually gave up the project.

**Thoughts:**
- Both Facebook and Twitter do not have the searches I most desire (location-based).

## Day 23: Monday, February 6, 2017
#### #Javascript30 video and image manipulation

**Today's Progress**:
- Long JS video today but I made it!

**Thoughts:**
- Really cool to see how the data in images is stored.
- Tons of video and image manipulation stuff I'll never use.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/19%20-%20Webcam%20Fun

## Day 24: Tuesday, February 7, 2017
#### #Javascript30 video and image manipulation

**Today's Progress**:
- Awesome speech-recognition Javascript video.

**Thoughts:**
- Oh man I never thought about using speech recognition (doesn't seem like a technology that would be accessible to someone with my skills), but whew, there's so much one could do!

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/20%20-%20Speech%20Detection

## Day 25: Wednesday, February 8, 2017
#### #Javascript30 day 21

**Today's Progress**:
- Didn't do much really - the JS video needed an emulator, so fuck it.

## Day 26: Thursday, February 9, 2017
#### #Javascript30 highlight tracking

**Today's Progress**:
- Pretty cool follow-the-highlight link span thing

**Thoughts:**
- Ok this Javascript business is kinda cool...

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/22%20-%20Follow%20Along%20Link%20Highlighter

## Day 27: Friday, February 10, 2017
#### CodeWars destroys me

**Today's Progress**:
- Haven't solved this algorithm efficiently enough. BUT I did learn a lot about Ruby methods and the gem `ruby-prof` which allows you to benchmark your code.

**Thoughts:**
- Worth doing, but also really irritating and I haven't solved it yet.

## Day 28: Saturday, February 11, 2017
#### HackerRank and CodeWars

**Today's Progress**:
- Learned some more about algorithms and how much I suck at them.

**Thoughts:**
- Spent all damn day working on HackerRank stuff and feeling like.. well, like I don't have a computer science degree.

## Day 29: Sunday, February 12, 2017
#### Heapsort

**Today's Progress**:
- Understood heaps and heapsort!

**Thoughts:**
- It took me all damn day.
- Those MIT lectures are pretty helpful.
- The fact that Ruby starts indices at `0` and the pseudocode starts at 1 is really troublesome!

**Link to work:**

## Day 30: Monday, February 13, 2017
#### #Javascript30 Day 23 - Speech Synthesis

**Today's Progress**:
- #JS30 day 23, worked with some cool speech synthesis API browser stuff
- Also finally got to 5kyu in CodeWars.
- Also also spent hours working on SpeechToDoc. It's coming along nicely!

**Thoughts:**
- I don't know what I would ever use this for, but it's not so bad. Maybe in combo with the print-user-words on screen thing - if it can talk back to you, that's good.

**Link to work:**

## Day 31: Tuesday, February 14, 2017
#### #Javascript30 Day 24 - Sticky Nav

**Today's Progress**:
- #JS30 day 24 - not much new code, but very useful

**Thoughts:**
- Wow, yesterday I tweeted I was 1/3 of the way done with #100DaysOfCode. Whoops.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/24%20-%20Sticky%20Nav

## Day 32: Wednesday, February 15, 2017
#### SpeechToDoc

**Today's Progress**:
- Added index page for documents: display them on cards with a fun highlighting JS
- Added show page
- Created Document model

**Thoughts:**
- I need to have bigger ideas. These things I can build in a few hours are not going to impress anyone.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/speechtodoc/tree/voice_functions


## Day 33: Saturday, February 18, 2017
#### Snack!

**Today's Progress**:
- Created a new Snack app.
- Installed Devise Users, gave them friendships, profiles.

**Thoughts:**
- I can feel how much better I understand these libraries - what they are doing and why. But also how wide the gap in knowledge is between myself and the people who built them.
- I've got a lot of work to do on this app but I think it could actually be kind of good.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/snack-app/

## Day 34: Sunday, February 19, 2017
#### Snack

**Today's Progress**:
- Made a stupid-simple nav bar for temporary use. Tried to get Foundation to play nice but just gave up for now.
- Users have languages, and languages they are learning.

**Thoughts:**
- I'm fighting with Rails on the language_list but I don't have a better way to do it yet.

## Day 35: Monday, February 20, 2017
#### #Javascript30 - Stripe fun dropdown menus

**Today's Progress**:
- Got through the remaining longest JS30 video. It's smooth sailing from here.

**Thoughts:**
- This has been a great tutorial series. Kind of can't believe that people make these amazing things and then give them away for free.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/26%20-%20Stripe%20Follow%20Along%20Nav


## Day 36: Wednesday, February 22, 2017
#### #Javascript30 - drag and scroll && lots of improvements to Gbg Events

**Today's Progress**:
- JS30 day 27 - nearly done with the series.
- Updated Facebook search (makes 3 api calls). Removed "today" functionality.
- Updated Library search to find only non-recurring events.
- Updated all three event listings to include dates, links.

**Thoughts:**
- Interesting concept for JS30 but the tutorial wasn't something I would build.
- Hell yeah Ggb Events! Like 50% better now.

## Day 37: Thursday, February 23, 2017
#### #Javascript30 - video speed controller

**Today's Progress**:
- JS28 (almost done!)
- Fixed up date formatting, sort order for Gbg Events.
- Remove Facebook events that have already occurred, gather more events that don't necessarily list "Gothenburg" as their location.

**Thoughts:**
- Not much going on with this JS30 video.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/28%20-%20Video%20Speed%20Controller

## Day 38: Saturday, February 25, 2017
#### Gbg Events - caching

**Today's Progress**:
- Some research on caching, started caching Gbg Events data.

**Thoughts:**
- Next up: need to ping the servers every half hour using some kind of automated action thing.

**Link to work:**
http://apimachine.herokuapp.com/

## Day 39: Sunday, February 26, 2017
#### Snack - users have language matches

**Today's Progress**:
- Created simple algorithm for users to get matched by language; create `matches` page

**Thoughts:**
- This thing is shaping up ok.

## Day 40: Monday, February 27, 2017
#### #Javascript30 - day 29!

**Today's Progress**:
- JS30 #29 - Countdown clock

**Thoughts:**
- It seems like I've been doing these Javascript tutorials forever.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30/tree/master/29%20-%20Countdown%20Timer

## Day 41: Tuesday, February 28, 2017
#### #Javascript30 - last day!

**Today's Progress**:
- Whack-a-mole, last tutorial on JS30

**Thoughts:**
- I knew right away when we'd need recursion, so that makes me feel awesome.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/JavaScript30

## Day 42: Wednesday, March 1, 2017
#### #Javascript30 - getting all my notes in order

**Today's Progress**:
- Spent ~2 hours compiling notes from JS30. No actual coding but lots of time thinking about Javascript.

**Thoughts:**
- I got more response to this article than any single other thing I've ever written in the tech world, maybe in any world.
- I also had two interviews today and spent the rest of the time in a cafe. It was a weird day.

## Day 43: Friday, March 3, 2017
#### Snack - users can message each other

**Today's Progress**:
- Users can send messages to each other if they are friends.

**Thoughts:**
- I didn't use a library but there are some serious problems with the implementation. I want to dig in further and create library-like methods so I can do things like `user.send_message` and the like.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/snack-app/pull/7

## Day 44: Saturday, March 4, 2017
#### Snack - users can message each other

**Today's Progress**:
- Finished up messaging on Snack app:
Users can message each other. They see an unread count in the nav bar.
- Lots of refactoring

**Thoughts:**
- I learned a lot about custom validations, helpers and refactoring.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/snack-app/pull/7

## Day 45: Sunday, March 5, 2017
#### Snack - forum

**Today's Progress**:
- Used Thredded to install forum for users

**Thoughts:**
- This freakin' "gem" is crazy - so much beautiful functionality out of the box.
- I will probably end up replacing the messaging thing I installed last time.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/snack-app/pull/8

## Day 46: Monday, March 6, 2017
#### Snack - forum

**Today's Progress**:
- Installed some sass in my project!
- Added a few tests for forum functionality.

**Thoughts:**
- Not quite as simple as I thought, but also just fine.

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/snack-app/pull/8

## Day 47: Tuesday, March 7, 2017
#### Snack - forum

**Today's Progress**:
- Cleaned up forum posts on user profiles

**Thoughts:**
- I lost faith in Thredded for just a minute, but what I needed was there, just under a different name (`postable`, instead of `topic`).

**Link to work:**
https://github.com/AmberWilkie/snack-app/pull/8
