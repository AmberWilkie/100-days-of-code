**Thoughts:**
- There's so much shit I don't know about CSS.

**Fuck-ups:**
- No need to work out AM/PM on the clock. 361 degrees == 1 degrees. Dur.

#### Our very first real "coffee date".

**Today's Progress**: More or less figured out Javascript Day 2 on my own, once I got the correct function calls and CSS properties from the dude. It was a pretty simple one, really.

**Thoughts:**
