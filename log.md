## Day -3: Friday, January 6, 2017
#### First day back at a computer, for real, after Morocco

**Today's Progress**: Finished the jQuery intro tutorial. Worked through the first #Javascript30 video.

**Thoughts:**
- There's so much shit I don't know about Javascript.

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day -2: Saturday, January 7, 2017
#### Did a lot of shopping today, but still managed to get my brain to do this

**Today's Progress**: More or less figured out Javascript Day 2 on my own, once I got the correct function calls and CSS properties from the dude. It was a pretty simple one, really.

**Thoughts:**
- There's so much shit I don't know about CSS.

**Fuck-ups:**
- No need to work out AM/PM on the clock. 361 degrees == 1 degrees. Dur.

## Day -1: Sunday, January 8, 2017
#### Our very first real "coffee date".

**Today's Progress**: More or less figured out Javascript Day 2 on my own, once I got the correct function calls and CSS properties from the dude. It was a pretty simple one, really.

**Thoughts:**
- Holy crap, CSS variables are awesome.

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day 1: Monday, January 9, 2017
#### The official first day of #100DaysOfCode for #CodeNewbies

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 of #Javascript30 - all about arrays and array functions.

**Thoughts:**
- Tough stuff! Lots of technical talk and wrapping your head around iterations and such. I'm demonstrably better at Javascript already.
- I need to spend more time understanding `.reduce()`

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day 2: Tuesday, January 10, 2017
#### Mega CSS day: Flexbox

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of #Javascript30 - the CSS Flexbox (cool stuff)

**Thoughts:**
- Tons of things I don't know about CSS. Should bone up on that a bit so I can make things pretty.
- Flexbox is cool.

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day 3: Wednesday, January 11, 2017
#### Working more with `.filter()` and Regex

**Today's Progress**: Day 6 of #Javascript30 - more basic stuff and also easy callbacks!

**Thoughts:**
- Need to find a time when I can do some more digging into these concepts I am just marking to figure out later.

**Fuck-ups:**
- You can't fuck up that much on tutorials, really.

## Day 4: Friday, January 13, 2017
#### The easiest #Javascript30 video yet.

**Today's Progress**: Day 7 of #Javascript30 - some more array methods.

**Thoughts:**
- This video was pretty easy, partially because I am starting to get more familiar with the JS syntax itself.
- I had to miss a day yesterday because we had company for dinner.

**Fuck-ups:**
- I really could have pushed and worked last night, but then I'd have had zero relaxation time and one needs relaxation time.
