# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day -3: Friday, January 6, 2017
#### First day back at a computer, for real, after Morocco

**Today's Progress**: Finished the jQuery intro tutorial. Worked through the first #Javascript30 video.

**Thoughts:**
- There's so much shit I don't know about Javascript.

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day -2: Saturday, January 7, 2017
#### Did a lot of shopping today, but still managed to get my brain to do this

**Today's Progress**: More or less figured out Javascript Day 2 on my own, once I got the correct function calls and CSS properties from the dude. It was a pretty simple one, really.

**Thoughts:**
- There's so much shit I don't know about CSS.

**Fuck-ups:**
- No need to work out AM/PM on the clock. 361 degrees == 1 degrees. Dur.

## Day -1: Sunday, January 8, 2017
#### Our very first real "coffee date".

**Today's Progress**: More or less figured out Javascript Day 2 on my own, once I got the correct function calls and CSS properties from the dude. It was a pretty simple one, really.

**Thoughts:**
- Holy crap, CSS variables are awesome.

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day 1: Monday, January 9, 2017
#### The official first day of #100DaysOfCode for #CodeNewbies

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 of #Javascript30 - all about arrays and array functions.

**Thoughts:**
- Tough stuff! Lots of technical talk and wrapping your head around iterations and such. I'm demonstrably better at Javascript already.
- I need to spend more time understanding `.reduce()`

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day 2: Tuesday, January 10, 2017
#### Mega CSS day: Flexbox

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 of #Javascript30 - the CSS Flexbox (cool stuff)

**Thoughts:**
- Tons of things I don't know about CSS. Should bone up on that a bit so I can make things pretty.
- Flexbox is cool.

**Fuck-ups:**

## Day 3: Wednesday, January 11, 2017
#### Working more with `.filter()` and Regex

**Today's Progress**: Day 6 of #Javascript30 - more basic stuff and also easy callbacks!

**Thoughts:**
- Need to find a time when I can do some more digging into these concepts I am just marking to figure out later.

**Fuck-ups:**
- You can't fuck up that much on tutorials, really.

## Day 4: Friday, January 13, 2017
#### The easiest #Javascript30 video yet.

**Today's Progress**: Day 7 of #Javascript30 - some more array methods.

**Thoughts:**
- This video was pretty easy, partially because I am starting to get more familiar with the JS syntax itself.
- I had to miss a day yesterday because we had company for dinner.

**Fuck-ups:**
- I really could have pushed and worked last night, but then I'd have had zero relaxation time and one needs relaxation time.

## Day 5: Sunday, January 15, 2017
#### I'm going to count two days today. Yesterday was ...yes.

**Today's Progress**: Day 8 of #Javascript30 - fun stuff with canvas and drawing.

**Thoughts:**
- HSL color picker is a handy guy that is more logical than hex codes.
- Need to keep `if(!var) return;` in mind for shutting down functions in the middle.

**Fuck-ups:**
- Yesterday was just fun, but I could have squeezed in work time in the morning. Thankfully I intend to make up for it today.

## Day 6: Sunday, January 15, 2017
#### I'm going to count two days today.

**Today's Progress**: Day 9 of #Javascript30 - fun stuff with canvas and drawing.

**Thoughts:**
- Today's video was just a bunch of `console.log` options. It works out ok because the canvas thing was colorful and fun.

## Day 7: Monday, January 16, 2017
#### I'm going to count two days today.

**Today's Progress**: Day 10 of #Javascript30 - shift and checkboxes.

**Thoughts:**
- I did it! I used a bunch of `if` statements and `while` loops and far too many `eventListener`s but no worries, it's done.
- Feels good to get a thing right, even if it needs significant refactoring.
- `e` has `.shiftKey` available. Probably all kinds of useful other stuff, too.

## Day 8: Tuesday, January 17, 2017
#### All about videos on #Javascript30

**Today's Progress**: Day 11 of #Javascript30 - styling the video player.

**Thoughts:**
- Did it again, mostly.
- `if` statements are way out of style.
- Need to remember `offsetWidth` for finding the width of elements, as they are (not as set in CSS).

## Day 9: Wednesday, January 18, 2017
#### Silly key sequence detection

**Today's Progress**: Day 12 of #Javascript30 - key seq detection.

**Thoughts:**
- I didn't expect to have time today, so that's a win.
- `.splice()` is a helpful little method

## Day 10: Thursday, January 19, 2017
#### Animating images in on scroll

**Today's Progress**: Day 13 of #Javascript30.

**Thoughts:**
- There are *so many* window events.
- I can't imagine ever using this particular animation, but knowing about `scroll` properties and other window events is really great.

## Day 11: Friday, January 20, 2017
#### Copy vs. Reference

**Today's Progress**: Day 14 of #Javascript30.

**Thoughts:**
- This lesson was really boring but ok, probably important.
- Who knew you couldn't just copy arrays and expect them to carry on as though they were completely new objects!

## Day 12: Saturday, January 21, 2017
#### localStorage & event delegation

**Today's Progress**: Day 15 of #Javascript30.

**Thoughts:**
- Lots of good stuff today - good learning going on.
- Halfway through the Javascript30 challenge!
- Really happy about all the protesting today around the world. If only it can be momentum that *builds* and we can fight authoritarianism and hatred in all forms.

## Day 13: Sunday, January 22, 2017
#### Working on a personal project: "Gö-vents" (until I can think of a better name)

**Today's Progress**:
- Added a "today" button to search for things happening today.
- Removed the crazy-confusing web-scraping we put together during a hack-a-thon and used the API Gothenburg produces (whoops on not finding that before).

**Thoughts:**
- I thought I might get this guy in a position to put in my portfolio today but no such luck.
- I need to add a lot more styling to this guy - hopefully some cards for each event.
- I'd also like to pull in more places to search - things like the library, perhaps, which I think are actually not being added here, but also music venues, Chalmers, etc.
- I hate "Gö-vents" (the name) so much I might die.

## Day 14: Monday, January 24, 2017
#### Drop-shadow animation with Javascript

**Today's Progress**:
- #Javascript30 Day 16
- Liked it so much I threw the code into my portfolio. Made it subtle enough so folks who hate it can safely ignore it.

**Thoughts:**
- My portfolio is so childish... I need to figure out a nicer presentation.
- On the other hand, I need to build some stuff that didn't come directly from the camp.

## Day 15: Thurdsay, January 25, 2017
#### Fighting with APIs

**Today's Progress**:
- Added Facebook events to event aggregator. I have three APIs working on the damn app now.

**Thoughts:**
- Facebook API is really not documented as well as one might think.

**To do:**
- Prettify the damn thing up. I want to get cards working from foundation so this thing actually looks nice and I can add it to the portfolio.

## Day 16: Friday, January 26, 2017
#### Fighting with Foundation and Alignment

**Today's Progress**:
- Installed Foundation to "Gö-vents" (Jesus, that needs a new name)
- Wrapped responses in Foundation's accordion, and those in the grid.


**Thoughts:**
- Why is it always so damn hard to get things aligned?

**To do:**
- Work out some system to expand across the entire screen if the other guys aren't going to be around (of the three data types).
